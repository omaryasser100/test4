📌 Dataset Overview: Flight Delay Causes and Prediction

This dataset contains monthly aggregated flight arrival statistics for different airlines and airports in the United States.
Each row represents a unique (carrier, airport, month, year) combination. It is used to analyze and predict flight delays.

🔹 Temporal Features:
- year: Year of the record
- month: Month of the record
→ These help capture seasonal and yearly trends in flight delays

🔹 Airline Information:
- carrier: IATA code of the airline (e.g., "AA")
- carrier_name: Full name of the airline (used for display)

🔹 Airport Information:
- airport: IATA code of the airport (e.g., "LAX")
- airport_name: Full name of the airport (used for display)

🔹 Flight and Delay Statistics:
- arr_flights: Total number of arriving flights per month
- arr_del15: Number of flights delayed more than 15 minutes
→ Delay Rate = arr_del15 / arr_flights

🔹 Cancellation & Diversion:
- arr_cancelled: Number of canceled flights
- arr_diverted: Number of diverted flights

🔹 Delay Duration (in Minutes):
- arr_delay: Total delay time in minutes across all delayed flights

💡 Early EDA Insights:
- The dataset has missing values, especially in delay reason columns, which were handled by row dropping.
- Delay patterns are strongly seasonal — summer and winter months show more delays.
- Some airports consistently report higher delays.
- Delay ratio and total delay time are skewed features and may need transformation.
